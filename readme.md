# Sharing Is Caring Project #
## By Thomas Murphy ##

###Brief  -  This project is about using code (HTML, CSS and a dash of JavaScript) creatively to communicate and advocate a cause you care about [...(read more)](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Web-development-workshop/tree/2016/projects/sharing-is-caring)###

###My Cause ; ###
I chose to do my Onepage website about the flooding that affected the UK the last Festive season (2015-2016), as well as touching upon some of the previous effects the floods over the last 4/5 years have had upon the country and those affected.

###Targert Audience ; ###
From the beginning of my designs, I chose to make my website very animated, interesting, and more sotrylike so that it was more interesting to look at than just a bunch of information on a screen. This makes it appealing to a wide audience, icluding children aged 16+ and not just adults. My main target audience however are the people who are not affected by the flooding in the UK, and those who know of it and just don't think it's that serious.

###My End Result Goal ;###
I want those that read my whole website to then sign a petition that I will create, for the UK Government to discuss in Parliment, the need to increase the funding on UK Flood Prevention and Rescue, after the following cuts have left those affected in awful conditions, and to spend the tax payers money on the UK first, as opposed to paying out to other struggling countries or towards bombing Syria.
